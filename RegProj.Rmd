## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
raw <- read.csv("final_data.csv")
# summary(raw)

raw$Is_Buying_Most_Popular = as.factor(raw$Is_Buying_Most_Popular)
raw$Country = as.factor(raw$Country)
vc <- c("United Kingdom", "Germany", "France")


raw$Country2[raw$Country !="United Kingdom"] <- "Others"
raw$Country2[raw$Country =="United Kingdom"] <- "United Kingdom"
raw$Country=as.factor(raw$Country2)
raw$RFMSeg<-as.integer((raw$Recency_Quantile+raw$Frequency_Quantile+raw$Monetory_Value_Quantile))
# raw$RFMSeg<-as.integer(((raw$Monetory_Value_Quantile)*3))

raw$RFMSeg=as.factor(raw$RFMSeg)
raw=raw[,-c(3,19,20,21,23)]
# Only considering sales and not returns(positive Net Income)
raw[raw$Y_Income <= 0,]$Y_Income = 1
# is.numeric (raw$Orders_Unique)

```


```{r}
# final summary of the dataset
summary(raw)
set.seed(1)


library(caret)
dt = sort(sample(nrow(raw), nrow(raw)*.7))
train<-raw[dt,]
test<-raw[-dt,]

```


## Exploratory Data Analysis

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
boxplot(log(Y_Income)~Country, data=train, col= blues9)
boxplot(log(Y_Income)~RFMSeg, data=train, col= blues9)
boxplot(log(Y_Income)~Is_Buying_Most_Popular, data=train, col= blues9)
```
## Interpretation

There are possible outliers. 
Scaling might be a good option here as well. 


##  Scatterplots for monetory vs quantitative predictors

```{r}

# First 4 predictors vs Y_income

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
for (i in c(1:19)){
  
  if (!(i %in% c(15,16,18,19))){
    
    
  col_name = names(train[i]) 
  {
  plot(train[,i], train$Y_Income, xlab= col_name, ylab = "Post 6 months Net Revenue ")
  abline(lm(Y_Income ~ train[,i], data =  train), col = 2)
  }
  }
}

```

General trend: Graphically, Orders_unique, Total Items purchased, Monetary value, and sales revenue seems to have a strong and positive relationship with the response variable but linearity is not clear and will have to be looked into at residual analysis. Itwould also appear that predictors related to cancellations have a negative relation, possible due to influential points as in the case for total items returned.


Outliers: We may also have possible outliers in upper left and right portions of the graphs that will need further investigation. Some of the points with heavy cancellations appear to be outliers from a business perspective as they are very unlikely to happen again.


## Correlations:

```{r}

library(corrplot)

# Set color codes
gtblue = rgb(0, 48, 87, maxColorValue = 255)
techgold = rgb(179, 163, 105, maxColorValue = 255)
buzzgold = rgb(234, 170, 0, maxColorValue = 255)
bobbyjones = rgb(55, 113, 23, maxColorValue = 255)

# Select numerical variables
dat.num <- na.omit(train[ , which(sapply(train, is.numeric))])
# Create correlation matrix
corr <- cor(dat.num)
# Create correlation plot
col <- colorRampPalette(c(buzzgold,"white", gtblue))(10)
par(mfrow=c(1,1))
corrplot(corr, method = "circle", type = "upper", tl.col="black", col = col, tl.cex=0.5)

```

```{r}
cor(train[sapply(train, is.numeric)])


```


There is a very strong and positive correlation between Sales_Revenue and Y_income. There are negative correlations between variables related to cancellation and for others we see positive correlation between the predicting variables and the response variable.
In addition, we see strong correlation among some of the predicting variables suggesting that multicollinearity might be a problem in a model that uses all predictors. 

## Fitting the Multiple Linear Regression Model

```{r}

# fit full model
model_full <-lm(Y_Income~., data=train)
# Display summary
summary(model_full)

```


## Significance of  variables

```{r}

# Signiciant Coefficients
which(summary(model_full)$coeff[,4]<0.01)


print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
## Insignificant variables
# Insignificant Coefficients
which(summary(model_full)$coeff[,4]>0.01)


# Gievn all other variables in the model
```


## Overall Significance

Because the p value associated to the F-statistic (<2.2e-16) is less than the α level, we reject the null hypothesis that all slope coefficients are equal to zero, and state that the model is statistically significant at an α level of 0.01.


## checking the significance of newly created and interaction variables terms using F-partial test:
```{r}

model_original <- lm(Y_Income ~ Orders_Unique + Returns_Unique + Total_Items_Purchased + Total_Items_Returned + Sales_Revenue + Return_Refund + Monetory_Value  + Country , data = train)
# colnames(raw)


#  Quantity_Basket, Types_Items_Purchased, Unique_Item_Per_Basket, Types_Items_Returned, Unique_Item_Per_Return, Average_Unit_Price_Purchase, Average_Unit_Refund_Return, Is_Buying_Most_Popular,Recency, RFMSeg
# model_full <-lm(Y_Income~., data=train)

# summary(model_original)
# summary(model_full)

anova(model_original,model_full)
```


since p-value of 1.37e-07 is almost 0, we reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for newly created and interaction variables terms are all 0. At least one of these variables is statsitically significant and adds to the explanatory power of the model.

## Checking for Outliers and Multicollinearity
```{r}
# Calculating Cook's distances
cook=cooks.distance(model_full)

# Plotting Cook's distances
plot(cook,type="h",lwd=3,col="red", ylab = "Cook's Distance")

# plot(cook)
abline(h=1, col="red")

```


As expected, we have outliers and we will need to check if they are influrential. 

```{r}
#Identify outliers
cat("Observation", which(cook>1), "has a cook's distance that is greater than 1 and therefore will be treated as outliers")
```

```{r}
# Remove outlier
train2<-train[ -which(cook>1),]

# fit full model without outliers
model_full_2 <-lm(Y_Income~., data=train2)
# Display summary
summary(model_full_2)

```

## Checking for Multicollinearity

```{r}

# VIF Threshold
cat("VIF Threshold:", max(10, 1/(1-summary(model_full_2)$r.squared)), "\n")

```


```{r}
# Calculate VIF
vif(model_full_2)
```

We have high multicollinearity for Total_Items_Purchased, Sales_Revenue and Monetory_Value. Total_Items_Purchased is important from a business perspective and we will retain it. As we saw in correlations betwenn predictors, Sales_Revenue and Monetory_Value have a very high correlation coefiicient of 0.955 and hence we will remove Monetory_Value as a predictor.


## model withut outliers and Monetory_Value
```{r}
# Removing Monetory_Value as a feature and building a model
train3 <- train2[,-c(12)]
# train3<-train3[train3$RFMSeg==0,]
# train3<-train3[,-c(18)]
model3 <-lm(Y_Income~., data=train3)
# Display summary
summary(model3)

# # Calculating Cook's distances
# cook=cooks.distance(model3)
# # Plotting Cook's distances
# plot(cook,type="h",lwd=3,col="red", ylab = "Cook's Distance")
# # plot(cook)
# abline(h=1, col="red")


## Significance of  variables
```

```{r}

# Signiciant Coefficients
which(summary(model3)$coeff[,4]<0.01)


print("--------------------------------------------------------------------------------")
## Insignificant variables
# Insignificant Coefficients
which(summary(model3)$coeff[,4]>0.01)

# Gievn all other variables in the model
```


## Overall Significance

Because the p value associated to the F-statistic (<2.2e-16) is still less than the α level, we reject the null hypothesis that all slope coefficients are equal to zero, and state that the model is statistically significant at an α level of 0.01.

## checking the significance of newly created and interaction variables terms using F-partial test:
```{r}

model_original <- lm(Y_Income ~ Orders_Unique + Returns_Unique + Total_Items_Purchased + Total_Items_Returned + Sales_Revenue + Return_Refund   + Country , data = train3)
# colnames(raw)


#  Quantity_Basket, Types_Items_Purchased, Unique_Item_Per_Basket, Types_Items_Returned, Unique_Item_Per_Return, Average_Unit_Price_Purchase, Average_Unit_Refund_Return, Is_Buying_Most_Popular,Recency, RFMSeg
# model_full <-lm(Y_Income~., data=train)

# summary(model_original)
# summary(model_full)

anova(model_original,model3)

```

since p-value of 0.006394-07 is less than significane level of 0.01, we reject the null hypothesis that the coefficients for newly created and interaction variables terms are all 0. At least one of these variables is statsitically significant and adds to the explanatory power of the model.



```{r}
# VIF Threshold
cat("VIF Threshold:", max(10, 1/(1-summary(model3)$r.squared)), "\n")
# Calculate VIF
vif(model3)

```
We don't have high multicollinearity in our model especially after factoring in domain knowledge. We can also deal with residual multicollinearity at the time of variable selection.


## Residual Analysis

### Checking linearity assumption:

```{r}

# Get standardized residuals
resids = rstandard(model3)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    
for (i in c(1:18)){
  col_name = names(train3[i]) 
  
  if (!(i %in% c(14,15,17,18))){
  plot(train3[,i], resids, xlab= col_name, ylab = "S. Residuals")
  abline(h=0, col="red")
  lines(lowess(train3[,i], resids), col='blue')
  }
}

```

From the scatterplots for predictors, we can see that the residuals exhibit an almost linear shape with evenly distributed residuals around 0 line, which indicates an almost linear realationship between predictors and response variables.

Overall, the linearity assumption does seem to hold.

Note: The blue line is a smooth fit to the residuals, intended to make it easier to identify a trend.


### Checking for constant variance and uncorrelated errors

```{r}

# Plot of std. residuals versus fitted values
plot(model3$fitted.values, resids, xlab="Fitted Values", ylab=" S. Residuals")
lines(lowess(model3$fitted.values, resids), col='blue')
abline(h=0, col="red")

```

From the plot of the standardized residuals vs. fitted values, we see that constant variance assumption does not hold as the variance increase with increase in fitted values.    

There are no particular clusters. This suggests that the errors might be uncorrelated.


### Checking normality assumption

```{r}
# Plots for normality
hist(resids, col="orange", nclass=15)

```

```{r}

qqPlot(resids)


```

Using histograms and qqplot, we see deviation from normality with heavy tails in QQ plot. The normality assumption does not appear to hold. Thus, a transformation on the response variable may better fit for our model.


# Transformation

```{r}
# summary(train3)

# Box-Cox transformation
bc<-boxCox(model3)

# Extract optimal lambda
opt.lambda<-bc$x[which.max(bc$y)]

# Rounded optimal lambda
cat("Optimal Lambda = ", round(opt.lambda/0.5)*0.5, end="\n")


```


## Optimal Lambda =  0.5

A lambda value = 0.5 equates to a square root transformation of the response variable.

```{r}
# train3 <- train2[,-c(12)]
# train3<-train3[train3$RFMSeg==1,]
# train3<-train3[,-c(18)]
model4 <-lm(Y_Income^(1/2)~., data=train3)
# Display summary
summary(model4)

```


```{r}

# Checking linearity assumption:
# Get standardized residuals
resids = rstandard(model4)
# colnames(train3)


par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    
for (i in c(1:18)){
  col_name = names(train3[i]) 
  
  if (!(i %in% c(14,15,17,18))){
  plot(train3[,i], resids, xlab = col_name, ylab = "S. Residuals")
  abline(h=0, col="red")
  lines(lowess(train3[,i], resids), col='blue')
  }
}
```
```{r}
# Checking for constant variance and uncorrelated errors
# Plot of std. residuals versus fitted values
plot(model4$fitted.values, resids, xlab="Fitted Values", ylab=" S. Residuals")
lines(lowess(model4$fitted.values, resids), col='blue')
abline(h=0, col="red")

### Checking normality assumption

# Plots for normality
hist(resids, col="orange", nclass=15)
qqPlot(resids)


```

We are seeing deviation from linearity assumption in case of square root transformation. Linearity assumption does not seem to hold too well.


From the plot of the standardized residuals vs. fitted values, we see that constant variance assumption still does not hold as the variance increase with increase in fitted values.    

There are no particular clusters. This suggests that the errors might be uncorrelated.


For histogram, we see better normality graphs but there are still heavy tails as per qq plot.  Normality assumption has improved although there are still visible tails.

In general, Square root transformation has not improved goodness of fit except for normality. 

Lets do variable selection!!!!


```{r}

# Create minimum model including an intercept
min.model <- lm( Y_Income ~ 1, data = train3)
# summary(min.model)


# Perform awise regression
step.model <- step(min.model, scope = list(lower = min.model, upper = model3),
direction = "both", trace = FALSE)
summary(step.model)

```

### Checking linearity assumption:

```{r}

# Get standardized residuals
resids = rstandard(step.model)

par(mfrow=c(2,2))
    
for (i in c(1:18)){
  col_name = names(train3[i]) 
  
  if (!(i %in% c(14,15,17,18))){
  plot(train3[,i], resids, xlab= col_name, ylab = "S. Residuals")
  abline(h=0, col="red")
  lines(lowess(train3[,i], resids), col='blue')
  }
}
